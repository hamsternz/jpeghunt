Hunt out JPEG (JFIF/EXIF) files in hard disk images and extracts them

I had an external 240GB USB drive that would not stay mounted - it was due to some failed sectors. 

It had some photos on it I wanted to keep, so I used DDRESCUE to extract most of the data from the drive into an image file, but it was still not mountable or FSCKable.

I then wrote this to hunt out JPEG images and extract them. Results were Surprisingly good. Got back 40k+ images, with nearly all being perfect.
